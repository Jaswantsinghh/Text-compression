 It is 1-byte (8 bit) instruction.
 It can do 16 bit additions also in 8-bit mp. 
 this instruction easily takes double the time needed to add two 8-bit numbers.
 registers - BC,DE,HL.

-> Memory Reference instructions
are isntructions which are in the habit to construct a reference to the memory and
consent to a program to have an access to the commanded data and 
that states as to from where the data is stashed away.
* Specifies 12-bit address, 3-bit opcode and 1-bit addressing mode for direct and indirect addressing.

-> What is virtual memory
feature of an operating system that enables a computer to be able to compensate shortages
 of physical memory by transferring pages of data from RAM to disk storage.

-> What is IR register?

 that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded.

-> why DMA is faster than other data transfer techniques?
The direct memory access or DMA mode of data transfer is faster amongst all the mode of data transfer .
 In this mode ,the device may transfer data directly to/from memory without any interference from the cpu .
The device request the cpu through a DMA controller to hold its data ,
address and control bus so that the device may transfer data directly to or from memory.

-> what is address bus?
The address bus allows the CPU to send the address to RAM, and the data bus allows the actual data transfer to the CPU.

-> RAR instructions?
RAR - Rotate Accumulator Right
 It rotates the Accumulator contents to the right by 1-bit position.

-> what is accumulator?
An accumulator is a 18 bit register for short-term, intermediate storage of arithmetic 
and logic data in a computer's CPU.

-> vectored interupts?
 a vectored interrupt is an I/O interrupt that tells the part of the computer that 
handles I/O interrupts at the hardware level that a request for attention from an I/O device 
has been received and and also identifies the device that sent the request.

-> Use of flag
Flags are a modified kind of register that record the condition of a microprocessor's calculation.
For example, a "zero status" flag is activated only when the microprocessor's calculation concludes
 with a "zero" status.

-> drawback of registers?
The main disadvantage of registers is that they're finite.
If a program has to manipulate more data than can fit in these registers, then it needs to use cache
 or main memory instead, which slows things down.

-> cold boot / Hard boot
To perform a cold boot (also called a "hard boot") means to start up a computer that is turned off.

-> ADI instructions?
ADI - ADd Immediate to Accumulator (8-bit / 1-byte)
The result of addition will be stored in the Accumulator.

-> cache memory
Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU.
It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed

-> implicit addressing mode
In implied addressing mode, the operands are specified implicitly in the definition of the instruction .
 All the instructions which reference registers that use an accumulator are implied mode instructions .
 Zero address instructions in a stack organised computer are also implied mode instructions .

-> What are intrupts?
An interrupt is a condition that halts the microprocessor temporarily to work on a different task
 and then return to its previous task. Interrupt is an event or signal that request to attention of CPU.
 This halt allows peripheral devices to access the microprocessor.

-> ANA instructions
ANA - And Accumulator

The AND operation performs bit-wise AND of the two operands.
 If X is a bit of Accumulator, and Y is a bit of the other operand in the same bit position,
 the AND operation is performed as per the following truth table.

-> priority interupt?
A priority interrupt is a system which decides the priority at which various devices, which
 generates the interrupt signal at the same time, will be serviced by the CPU.

-> Parity flag?
parity flag indicates if the numbers of set bits is odd or even in the binary representation
 of the result of the last operation.

-> STA Instructions
STA stands for Store Accumulator contents in memory
In this instruction Accumulator 8-bit content will be stored to memory location
whose 16-bit address is indicated in the instruction as a16. 
This instruction uses absolute addressing for specifying the destination.

-> Difference between 8085 vs 8086
* 8085 is 8-bit microprocessor and 8086 is enhanced version of 8086 and is 16-bir processor.
* 8085 uses nearly 6500 transistors amd 8086 uses nearly 29000 transistors
 
-> Applications of microprocessor
* RADAR
* SONAR
* Mobile phones

-> Different addressing mode
* Immediate mode - The operand is an immediate value is stored explicitly in the instruction. (ex SPIM)
* Index mode - The address of the operand is obtained by adding to the contents of the general register
 (called index register) a constant value.(Ex SPIM/SAL)
* Register mode - The name (the number) of the CPU register is embedded in the instruction.
* Direct mode - The address of the operand is embedded in the instruction code.

-> ALU and its functionalities
ALU - Arithematic Logical Unit is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.
The ALU performs simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logic operations, such as OR and AND.

-> Name diff flags of 8085 microp.
* Carry flag
* Auxillary flag 
* Sign flag
* Zero flag

-> Register vs memory
Registers are the smallest data holding elements that are built into the processor itself.
These are the memory locations that are directly accessible by the processor.


-> Cache memory vs main memory
Cache is a smaller and fast memory component in the computer which is inserted between
 the CPU and the main memory. To make this arrangement effective.
 The cache needs to be much faster than main memory.
CPU reads Cache Memory data before reading main memory.

-> What are registers?
A processor register (CPU register) is one of a small set of data holding places
 that are part of the computer processor. A register may hold an instruction,
 a storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).

-> Mapping? Associative memory?
The transformation of data from main memory to cache memory is called mapping. 
* Associative mapping
The associative memory stores both address and data
The address value of 15 bits is 5 digit octal numbers
 and data is of 12 bits word in 4 digit octal number.
 A CPU address of 15 bits is placed in argument register and the associative memory
 is searched for matching address.

* Direct Mapping
The CPU address of 15 bits is divided into 2 fields.
 In this the 9 least significant bits constitute the index field and the remaining 6 bits 
constitute the tag field. 
The number of bits in index field is equal to the number of address bits required to access cache memory.

* Set Associative mapping
In this we can store two or more words of memory under the same index address.
 Each data word is stored together with its tag and this forms a set.

-> What is Program Counter register and functionalities?
A program counter is a register in a computer processor that contains the address
 (location) of the instruction being executed at the current time.

-> What is ALE signal?
ALE - Address Enable Latch
is the control signal which is nothing but a positive going pulse generated when a new operation
 is started by microprocessor.

RISC - Reduced instruction set computer
CISC -Complex instruction set computer
* RISC requires more no of register, cisc ledd no of registers
* RISC- An instruction execute in a single clock cycle, cisc - Instruction takes more than one clock cycle
* RISC-An instruction fit in one word , CISC- Instructions are larger than the size of one word

-> imp of dma
The direct memory access or DMA mode of data transfer is faster amongst all the mode of data transfer 

-> disadvantage of dma
* DMA transfer requires a DMA controller to carry out the operation, hence more expensive system
* synchronization mechanisms must be provided in order to avid accessing non-updated information from RAM.
* DMA can lead to cache coherency problems.
